##Networking BerlinSir Isaiah Berlin (1909-1997), a philosopher, political thinker, and historian of ideas was also one of the great intellectual virtuosos of the twentieth-century and arguably its most influential Liberal thinker. Besides his reputation as “a Paganini of ideas,” Berlin was also known as an effervescent conversationalist and prolific correspondent. This collaborative research project, bringing together traditional humanistic scholarship, intellectual history and new data visualization tools, uses Berlin’s voluminous correspondences in order to reconstructs his intellectual and social worlds.  The project’s main aim is to provide scholars with an enhanced research tool that would allow them to locate Sir Isaiah’s place in the various philosophical and political circles and trends of his time, to chart the long distance flow of his ideas, to contextualize the development of his thought in a new way, and to stimulate new research questions. Additionally, this data rendering allows us to use Berlin as a window-opener whose personal story and contacts reveal the larger ideological and intellectual trends in twentieth century history. This way, tracing Berlin’s intellectual voyage uncovers a vital segment of a larger scholarly network during an exceptionally dramatic and turbulent period of transition.The project is conducted in partnership with Stanford University’s Humanities + Design Research LabData gathering collaboration: The Isaiah Berlin Literary Trust, Wolfson College, Oxford.###Research Team: **Arie Dubnov**: PI, Senior Lecturer at the School of History, University of Haifa, Israel
